Exercise 1:
How to check a variable’s type?
- In order to check a variable’s type, we can use interactive mode
In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?
-	When we use an illegal name. for instance:
	76trombones = 'big parade'
  More@ = 100
  Class = “hello hello”
